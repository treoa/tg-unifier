# Telegram Channel Unifier

The project began on behalf of the problem tracking several chats/channels on Telegram. So it has been decided to track them in one feed differentiating by topics.

To start using first please install requirements via

```console
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

After what create additional ```configs.py``` file and add ```api_id```, ```api_hash``` data from your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org)
